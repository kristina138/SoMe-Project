        <h2 class="goals-title">Setting our SoMe goals:</h2>
        <p class="goals-text">The first step of our strategy is to set our goals and be clear of what the benefits of creating a SoMe strategy are.</p>

        <ol>

            <li class="list-text">
                <h3 class="list-title">Our main goal is to generate more sales for nuuii:</h3> We want to showcase our new products through social media and in that way increase the reach those products can have.
            </li>

            <li class="list-text">
                <h3 class="list-title">Our second goal is to boost community engagement:</h3> Users nowadays respond to brands that are aware of their position in their community. When creating a loyal customer base we can rely on those customers to share our posts, leave reviews and create user generated content that promotes nuuii.
            </li>

            <li class="list-text">
                <h3 class="list-title">Our third goal is to drive more traffic to the website:</h3> We want to create links to our website through sponsored content and also we can track how many conversions we get from socials to actual sales when using promoted content.
            </li>

            <li class="list-text">
                <h3 class="list-title">Our fourth goal is to create a recognisable corporate style/image:</h3> Expanding the reach also means that people will look at our ads and have no idea what nuuii is. We want to create a cohesive style that can be easily remembered and recognised when they scroll through their feed. This also increases brand awareness.
            </li>

            <li class="list-text">
                <h3 class="list-title">Lastly, we assess what works and what didn’t:</h3> Expanding the reach also means that people will look at our ads and have no idea what nuuii is. We want to create a cohesive style that can be easily remembered and recognised when they scroll through their feed. This also increases brand awareness.
